# React Notes App

A simple React note-taking application with client-side storage, built with Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- Create notes with title and content
- View a list of all notes with timestamps
- Client-side persistence using localStorage
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Loading and error states for better UX

## Implementation Details

### Storage Strategy
- **localStorage**: Chosen for its simplicity and built-in browser support without requiring any external dependencies
- **Key naming convention**: Using namespace prefixing (`notesApp_notes`) to avoid collisions with other apps on the same domain

### Components
- **App.jsx**: Main container component handling state management and navigation
- **AddNote component**: Handles note creation with controlled form inputs
- **NotesList component**: Displays all saved notes with title, content preview, and timestamp

### Styling
- **Tailwind CSS**: Used for utility-first styling approach that allows for rapid development and consistent design patterns
- **Responsive design**: Layout adapts to different screen sizes without additional media queries
- **Visual feedback**: Includes loading indicators and error banners to improve user experience

### State Management
- **React useState**: For local component state
- **React useEffect**: For synchronizing with localStorage on component mount
- **Centralized error handling**: All storage operations are wrapped in try/catch blocks

### Error Handling
- **Storage failures**: Display user-friendly error messages when localStorage operations fail
- **Loading states**: Show visual feedback during asynchronous operations

## Future Improvements

- Add note editing functionality
- Implement note deletion
- Add categories or tags for notes
- Add search functionality
- Add dark mode support
